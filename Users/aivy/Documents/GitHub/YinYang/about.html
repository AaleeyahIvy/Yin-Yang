  <p>Hey there! You are probably wondering what the heck is this app about and why does it exist?
    Well that's what this page is for, to tell you about the orgin of the Yin Yang app and why it came about.
     My fiance and I were originally using an app called Tuned, it was created by Meta. <br>
     Although eventually they decided they decided to pull the plug and shut down the app in September.
   This deeply sadden us and we wanted to create an app for long distance couples who struggle like every other couple does when they are apart.</p>
   <hr>
    <p>What is the purpose of Yin Yang?
      Like previously mentioned we want to help long distance couples connect with each other and communicate better. 
      You know how sometimes your partner thinks that you can read their mind and figure out what's wrong without saying a word? 
      You get frustrated because that's literally impossible...we want to help partners communicate in a better form. 
      Tell your partner your mood, give them a visual by adding an emoji &#x1F62D; to that mood and maybe even a color/pattern. It's hard being in a relationship
      so make it easier by using yin yang!
    </p>
