# Yin-Yang App☯️
An app that lets couples stay connected while in long distance relationships or out of town.
Me and my partner were using the Tuned app made by Meta, but it is going to be shut down september 13th.
We were devastated and thought it would be a great project to create to add to our amateur resume and help us learn new technologies.

Technologies used:
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Hosting & Webservers:</td>
    <td>Firebase</td>
    <td>Apache</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Langauges:</td>
    <td>Html</td>
    <td>CSS</td>
    <td>JS</td>
    <td>Anime.js</td>
    <td>PHP</td>
    <td>ASP.NET</td>
  </tr>
</table>
