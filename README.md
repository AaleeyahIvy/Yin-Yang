# Yin Yang App ☯️

Originally this was going to be an app that lets couples stay connected while in long distance relationships or out of town.
Me and my partner were using the Tuned app made by Meta, but it is going to be shut down september 13th.
We were devastated and thought it would be a great project to create to add to our amateur resume and help us learn new technologies.
Although based on our beliefs, we decided we could turn this into a nice groupchat app that allows you to send pictures, play group games, message, and track your friends schedules. It can be hard to stay in touch with friends especially if you work and have responsibilities.
