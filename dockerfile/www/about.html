  <p>Hey there! You are probably wondering what the heck is this app about and why does it exist?
     Well that's what this page is for, to tell you about the orgin of the Yin Yang app and why it came about.
     Originally my fiance and I were originally using an app called Tuned, it was created by Meta. <br>
     Although eventually they decided they decided to pull the plug and shut down the app in September.
     Then we thought it would be better to create an app for friends so that they can keep in touch while apart or while having busy schedules.
     It's hard to keep up with friends and we definitely understand.

    <p>What is the purpose of Yin Yang?
      To stay in touch with friends and be able to plan events with each other. You can customize your group space however you want...
      share calendars, pictures, music, and play around with many other features. Basically discord 2...maybe lol.
    </p>
